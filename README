GSIM Command line tool

Image Characteristics:
512x512 png generated by the sdxl-turbo model. (FUTURE. ABLE TO USE JPEG)

Planned Supported Data types:
Text | Images | Audio | Video | In theory, anything

Character Encoding: 
UTF-8 encoding is used, allowing for multi-language text support.

Application type:
- Command-Line Interface (CLI): This is a command-line tool, runnable from any terminal or command prompt.
- Platform: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Dependencies: Requires Python 3.x and other dependencies listed in requirements.txt.


Security and Data Integrity

    Coverless Approach: By generating a new image based on the input data, this application does not rely on a "cover" image, avoiding modifications to pixel values and thereby enhancing security.
    Data Representation through Visual Patterns: Data is represented in complex visual patterns, making the generated images look like abstract art. This design increases the difficulty of distinguishing steganographic images from standard, non-encoded abstract images.

Limitations

    Data Types: The application currently supports only text data.
    User Interface: It is CLI-based with no graphical user interface (GUI) at this time.
    Image Interpretation: Generated images are abstract and non-representational, which can make it challenging to visually interpret them without knowledge of the encoding process.
